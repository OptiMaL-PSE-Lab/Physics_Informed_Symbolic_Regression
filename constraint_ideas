Concentration models:
    For both products and reactants: 
        -> at time x and x-1, the difference of concentrations should be close to zero (for large x's)
        -> maybe enforce that at time 0, concentration models must start from the initial concentrations

Rate models:
    For products:
        -> it must be positive at all times
        -> it monotonically decreases
        -> at time x and x-1, the difference of concentrations should be close to zero (for large x's)
    For reactants:
        -> it must be negative at all times
        -> it monotonically increases
        -> at time x and x-1, the difference of concentrations should be close to zero (for large x's)
